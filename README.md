### Дракон

Simple game about a russian(?) dragon and my never-ending **Quest** to make an actual game one day.

It seems I couldn't put myself together to start a project on python so far, so I decided to just hack away at the keyboard a little every day and see what comes from it. Nothing too fancy, or fancy at all.
(I am using [pygame](http://pygame.org/wiki/about) too, to make things easier for myself.)

**DISCLAIMER:** This code is being written by monkeys. :monkey:
